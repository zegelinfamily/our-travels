Another campervan trip, this time to see a bit more of Italy. After visiting friends in Switzerland we drove over the spectacular Simplon Pass into northern Italy and spent a wonderful 3 weeks visiting many of the famous lakes in the area followed by a visit to Ravenna, San Marino and the Frasassi Caves. We then spent some time visiting the beautiful cities and towns of Umbria and Tuscany before making a long drive back to Paris.
