So much to see and so little time. When planning this trip we made a huge map of the UK by photocopying a map onto 12 A4 size sheets of paper and marking all the ‘must see’ and ‘should see’ places with different coloured marker pens. There were so many interesting places to visit that half way through the trip we decided to completely skip Scotland and leave it for another time. Early in the trip the weather was very wet so we ended up visiting many places in a different order to what we had planned and it looks a bit like we were driving all over the place - which we were, but at least the distances were short. This was also our first trip with Adam.

This ended up being another 'Around the World' trip but in the opposite direction from our last trip, since we visited new York and family in California on the way home.
