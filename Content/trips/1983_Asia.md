This was a really big trip, spending around 6 months travelling around parts of Sumatra, Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka. Lots of unforgettable experiences were had and interesting places were visited on the way. There were so many highlights it’s hard to pick a few but the old temples of Pagan in Burma, the temple complexes of Khajuraho and the rock cut temples of Ellora and Ajanta in India were all amazing. We took a joy flight to Mount Everest from Kathmandu and visited Lake Toba in Sumatra. Most of the places we visited, including Phuket and Ko Samui in Thailand, were virtually undeveloped and vastly different from today. We also spent time in out of the way places like Chiang Mai, Mandalay, Pokhara, Goa and Varanasi. We even got caught up in Sri Lanka’s civil war.
