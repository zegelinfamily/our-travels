This trip had been on our bucket list for quite a while and it didnâ€™t disappoint. The variety of places we visited made every day fascinating. Everything from Titan missile silos to petrified forests, huge meteor craters, gigantic caves at Carlsbad, the ancient Indian settlements at Mesa Verde and the beautiful Canyon de Chelly and Grand Canyon, as well as the interesting old towns of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Los Alamos and the whole Trinity thing was also very interesting as was the National Solar Observatory, the Very Large Array, and Lowell observatory at Flagstaff, where they discovered Pluto.
