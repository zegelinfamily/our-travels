We’d enjoyed our previous stay at Phuket so much that we decided to do the same thing the next year. We had a different villa in the complex this time but it was still excellent with a private pool and all. We spent much of the month relaxing and going ‘local’. It did rain quite a bit more this time but we still managed to spend a lot of time out and about and eating at lots of excellent restaurants. At the end of our trip we spent a few days in the old Malaysian trading port of Malacca which we had last visited 30 years before.
