Our first trip together! A wonderful one month honeymoon in beautiful Bali. Totally basic accomodation but fabulous food and fascinating places to visit. Bali was only just being ‘discovered’ so everything was pretty laid back - Kuta was nothing like it is today. We hired a motorbike for the duration and took a 2 day tour with ’Simons Volcanic Tours’ through the centre and north of the island with a bunch of other people our age, which was great fun. We also took a side trip to Java to visit Borobodur and surrounds.
