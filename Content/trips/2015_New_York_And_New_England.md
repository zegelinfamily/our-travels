Lots of interesting things to see and do on this trip. In New York we spent some time visiting the art deco skyscrapers, a trip to the top of the Empire State building and a fascinating tour of Grand Central Station. In New Canaan we visited the Philip Johnson Glass House. We saw Yale and Harvard, visited Mark Twain's beautiful family home, and spent a few days in Rhode island visiting the guilded mansions of the rich and famous. In Barre we visited a huge granite quarry that makes tombstones and in Burlington we went on a tour and bought a teddy bear from the famous Vermont Teddy Bear factory. The factory even has it's own hospital for damaged bears! After that it was historic houses and towns until we got to the spectacular Niagra Falls. We walked across the border to Canada to see the falls from a different vantage point as well. A visit to the fabulous Corning Glass Museum and Bethel Woods where Woodstock was held all those years ago rounded out a great trip.
