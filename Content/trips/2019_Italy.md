We got invited to a wedding in Italy so we made the most of it, this time concentrating on the northern part of the country. After spending some time in Milan we headed to Mantagnana, a beautiful medieval walled town, where we managed to see their annual Palio with medieval parades and bare back horse races. In Verona we saw an opera in the ancient colosseum and drove around Lake Garda. After that we visited the interesting cities of Bologna and Parma, eating fantastic food along the way. Then a week visiting the interesting towns of the Cinque Terre as well as nearby Lucca, then home. Through the whole trip the weather was great and the food to die for.
