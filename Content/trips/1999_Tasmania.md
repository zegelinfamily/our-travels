A great school holiday trip to Tassie. There was heeps to see and do and the countryside was beautiful. Tasmania's early role in Australian history was very evident and at Port Arthur actual photographs of convicts making you appreciate just how recent much of that history is. Hobart was interesting, as were the Hastings Caves in the far south of the island. We also visited the beautiful and controversial Gordon Dam before heading across to the west coast. Along the way were very nice short scenic walks to rainforests and waterfalls. As we went further along everything felt very isolated and unspoilt - in a good way. In the north we visited Cradle Mountain, lots of caves and historic Devonport before heading home.
