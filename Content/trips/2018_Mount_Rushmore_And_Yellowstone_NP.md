An interesting trip marred by us both having bad colds, or worse. Still managed to see what we came for. Highlights were a helicopter ride over Mount Rushmore and surrounds, the Needles highway, a visit to the Badlands National Park and the Mammoth Site at Hot Springs.  After a long drive to beautiful Red Lodge, visiting Devils Tower on the way, we took a breathtaking drive over the Beartooth Highway, the highest highway in North America, to Yellowstone National Park. This was our second visit to the park and it didnâ€™t disappoint, with some of the geysers being extra active and a bear appearing near the side of the road.
