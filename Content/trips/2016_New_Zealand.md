On the spur of the moment we decided to take advantage of a - short lived - direct flight from Canberra to Wellington. Our main goal was to visit the beautiful Art Deco town of Napier and the surrounding wineries of Hawkeâ€™s Bay. After that we drove around the northern coast on to Rotorua and then down to Mount Egmont for a wonderful few days visiting several spectacular gardens in the area.
