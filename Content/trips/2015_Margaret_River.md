This was just a short trip to visit Perth, Fremantle and the Margaret River area. The botanical gradens in Perth were lovely and there were some interesting historical parts of Fremantle as well. We then moved on to our airbnb at Prevelly, on the beach, which was a great base for visiting the whole Margaret River area. We visited wineries, some very interesting and beautiful cave systems, and took tours of two historic lighthouses. Both lighthouses are located at the most western part of Australia and were very scenic. At Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse we managed to see lots of whales passing by, spouting water in the distance.
