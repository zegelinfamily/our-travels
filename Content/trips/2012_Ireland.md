Our trip to Ireland didn't disappoint. Apart from a few days here and there, we got really lucky with the weather with beautiful blue skies and sunshine. Dublin was fun, with a great live music scene and buskers everywhere, and the countryside was as green as you can imagine. Some of the highlights were the spectacular cliffs of Moher and Slieve League, the Dingle Peninsula and the Giants Causeway. The scenery was beautiful everywhere we drove and there were plenty of old monasteries, castles and ancient burial sites to visit. One memorable drive was over Conor Pass, a narrow single lane road to Dingle with great views all around and challenging occasional oncoming traffic. Near the pass itself there were pullouts and drivers used their headlights to signal when it was their turn to drive the few hundred meters to the next pullout.
