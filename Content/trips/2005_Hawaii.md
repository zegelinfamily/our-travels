We had always wanted to see a volcano erupting, so Hawaii was the obvious choice since the volcano on the main island is nearly always active. We spent a few days on Oahu doing the normal touristy things, including a really fascinating tour of Pearl Harbour and the USS Missouri, where the Japanese surrender in WW II happened. After that, it was off to the Big Island where we spent a week or so viewing the volcano up close, visiting a coffee plantation, orchid nursery and driving around the island, stopping off at various landmarks and waterfalls on the way. We then flew to the island of Kauai where we saw the Waimea Canyon and took a wonderful sailing cruise to the spectacular Nappali Coast.
