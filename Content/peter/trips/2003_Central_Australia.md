Another great school holiday trip, this time to Alice Springs and surrounds. We took a few day excursions around Alice to some nice scenic spots and the historic telegraph station. The station was built in 1871 and cut communication time between Australia and London from many months to a few hours! After that it was a long drive to Ayers Rock for a 3 day visit. The rock itself and the Olgas nearby were wonderful and well worth the drive. On the way back to Alice we stayed a night at Kings Canyon where we took a helicopter tour over the canyon and spent some time admiring the beautiful sandstone cliffs and unusual rock formations. The resort itself was also very nice considering just how isolated the area is.
