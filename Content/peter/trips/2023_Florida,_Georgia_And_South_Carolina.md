Another great US trip. This time we spent nearly a week at Miami Beach admiring the beautiful art deco hotels that lined the main street and visiting some famous landmarks in the area. We also had a fun day at Key West and saw some aligators at the Everglades National Park. Then an interesting drive up the west coast of Florida visiting the Edision workshops and Ford and Edison homes, the Ringling Circus Museum, the Dali Museum and Chihuli Gallery at St. Petersberg and the Tiffany Museum near Orlando. Then it was up to beautiful Charleston, Beaufort, Savanna and Fernandina Beach. In between we managed to see two SpaceX rockets take off, one of which was nearly a double in one night, which would have been a first, but the second flight was cancelled at the last 30 seconds. We did manage to see another take off a few weeks later on the way back to Miami for our trip home.
