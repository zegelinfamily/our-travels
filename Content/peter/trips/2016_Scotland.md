We had hoped to visit Scotland as part of our trip through the UK nearly 30 years ago but we completely ran out of time on that trip, so it was great to finally get here. As with Ireland we were really lucky with the weather, with sunshine and blue skies almost every day. After a great week in Edinburgh we left for the countryside, visiting lots of castles, old stately homes, ancient burial sites, battlegrounds and churches as well as some beautiful gardens. The scenery, especially in the Western Highlands and Skye, was fantastic. Stayed mostly in B&Bâ€™s along the way. In places they got pretty scarce and we had a few close calls, with sleeping in the car becoming an option. Thankfully that never happened.
