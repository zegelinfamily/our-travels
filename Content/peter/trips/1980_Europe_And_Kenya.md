My parents were living in Kenya so of course we visited. We went to a bunch of wildlife parks including Tree Tops and Samburu, then spent a week near the old port of Mombassa, lazing on the beach. In those days there was no direct flight to from Australia to Africa so we had to go via London. We decided to make the most of it and spent a week in London, then hired a car for 3 weeks to tour parts of France, Italy, Germany and Holland. This was my first time driving on the wrong side of the road in Europe, but since we hired the car in the UK, it was also on the wrong side, so.. doubly tricky! 

This was our first trip to Europe together so we mainly visited the highlights, resolving to return soon enough.
