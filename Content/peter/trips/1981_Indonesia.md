We had loved our honeymoon trip to Bali a few years earlier so we resolved to go back - with a few friends this time. Everything was developing rapidly and the changes in just a few years were astonishing - shades of things to come. Still lots of great food and beautiful scenery. We also took a side trip to Singapore to see the sights and stock up on duty free goodies, which was a thing back in the day.
