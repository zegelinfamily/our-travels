This is just the bare bones outline of an epic trip we did right up the East Coast of Australia all the way to Cairns and back. At the time we were half thinking of moving to Queensland so we spent quite a bit of time looking at various places on the way up. We spent the whole trip of about 3 months camping in a 2 man tent but had a wonderful time and saw many interesting places even if we did get washed out a few times. At Airlie Beach we found a travel brochure with full of half price vouchers for various activities so we booked a few. One was a beautiful tour out to the reef which was a real bargain because the catamaran broke down before we got to the reef so they gave us a free day at the Hamilton Island Resort, lunch included, and another voucher to go out to the reef a few days later! A few days later we took a large yacht to Whitehaven Beach where our small group had the whole beach to ourselves and which is supposed to have the whitest sand in the world. 3x2 day trips for the price of 2!
