After visiting family in Kinglake we decided to take the long way back home via the Great Ocean Road. The drive was great with lots of interesting coastal towns, lighthouses and nature reserves, and walks and lookouts along the way. A highlight was a fantastic helicopter ride over the 12 Apostles, which is an amazing way to see them up close. After that we took a leisurely few days stopping off at Mount Gambier, the Coonawarra wine district and the wonderful Naracoorte Caves National Park, before heading home.
