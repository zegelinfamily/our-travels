This was just a quick trip mainly to visit Ankor Wat in Cambodia. We spent 3 days following in the footsteps of Lara Croft as we explored the temple ruins during the day, followed by eating and drinking at some of the wonderful restaurants along the main food street of Siem Reap. We then had a relaxing two week holiday on the island of Phuket, staying at a luxury resort. This was our first time back to Phuket since our big trip trough Asia in 1983 and it had changed dramatically. The quiet and isolated beach where we had stayed all those years ago was now a bustling town with many hotels and resorts. It was still fun though, our resort was beautiful and there were plenty of great restaurants nearby.
