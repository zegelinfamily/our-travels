We finally made it to Sicily after having to cancel a month out in 2020 because of Covid, but it was worth the wait. The island has a fascinating history going back to prehistory and just about everyone has invaded at one time or another, so there was a great mix of Greek temples, Roman villas, Norman castles and Spanish and Italian palaces. Earthquakes in the late 1600s wiped out many towns in the south and the palaces and public buildings were rebuilt from the local sandstone in a very harmonious Baroque style that we found was much nicer than the European Baroque.

The food was also great and the historic centres of many of the old towns at night were beautiful.
