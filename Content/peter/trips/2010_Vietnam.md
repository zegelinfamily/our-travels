We took advantage of a relatively cheap airfare to visit Vietnam, with a 3 day stopover in Darwin. There were quite a few interesting things to do in Darwin so it was worth the stopover. Vietnam was great. We spent a few days in Saigon visiting the sights and enjoying the food. We also went on a 3 day bicycle tour around the Mekong River area which was fun. We were by far the oldest on the tour but managed to keep up just fine and the youngies were fascinated hearing about our travel exploits. We then spent a really nice week relaxing at a hotel resort on the coast, taking a few day trips to the local sights and enjoying the wonderful food.
