Spent a few days seeing the sights of Bangkok before heading off to the island of Koh Samui, which Chris and I had last visited nearly 20 years before. As usual, a lot had changed and not for the better. We still enjoyed it though, and the food was great. We also hired a car for the day and drove around the island stopping at various handicraft shops and sites along the way. Towards the end of the day we visited a Buddhist monastery that had a well preserved mummified monk on display in a glass case. Fascinating! Singapore had changed a lot too, but was still great fun.
