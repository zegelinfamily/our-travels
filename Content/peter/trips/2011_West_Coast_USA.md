All our trips to the US have been really interesting and this one was no exception. Virtually every day there was something different to see, from the majestic redwood forests and coastline of Northern California to Mount St. Helens, Portland and the waterfalls of the Columbia River Gorge, Seattle and the Boeing Factory, the mile wide Grand Coulee Dam and of course Yellowstone National Park and the Tetons. The drive through Montana was epic, with a beautifully maintained 3+3 lane highway, no traffic at all, and the majestic scenery unfolding in front of us. There were also some fun surprises like the unusual houses in Eureka and the remnants of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion experiment at EBR-1. A really great trip.
