Our first road trip in the US. After visiting Disneyland and Universal Studios in LA we drove up the interesting coast to San Jose to visit family. After a few days we revisted Yosemite then drove over the mountains to Mono Lake and Death Valley. We spent a few days in Las Vegas then a great trip through many of the beautiful National Parks of Utah and Arizona, including Zion, Bryce, Capital Reef and Monument Valley. We also saw the Grand Canyon from the north rim, which is quite out of the way. After that, it was back to Las Vegas and LA, and home.
