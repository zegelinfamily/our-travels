Our first road trip in the US. After spending a few evenings at Disneyland and a day at Universal Studios in LA we drove up the interesting coast road to San Jose, stopping at Hearst Castle, to visit family. After a few days visit we drove to Yosemite then over the mountains to Mono Lake and through Death Valley. We spent a few days in Las Vegas staying at some amazing hotels, then a great trip through many of the beautiful National Parks of Utah and Arizona, including Zion, Bryce, Capitol Reef and Monument Valley. We also saw the Grand Canyon from the north rim, which is quite out of the way. After that, it was back to Las Vegas and LA, and home.
