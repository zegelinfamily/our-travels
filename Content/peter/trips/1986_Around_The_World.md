This was another really huge trip with most of the time spent campervanning around France and Spain. We started by visiting family in California and New York, then on to London and Paris for a week each. We then spent months visiting so many interesting places around France and Spain and visiting friends in Switzerland, before returning to Paris. The third part of our trip was visiting a friend in Florence and then on to Istanbul by train and bus. We then bussed our way through western Turkey making our way back to Athens through Rhodes, Crete and some of the Greek islands before the final part of our trip - Hong Kong, Thailand and Indonesia. Epic!
