We hadn't been to Cairns for many years so we took advantage of a school holiday to visit again. The first time we vsiited our accomodation was the local campground and a tiny tent but this trip we stayed at nice hotels and resorts by the beach. We visited Port Douglas and Daintree and drove right up to Cape Tribulation, which we had missed on our first trip as the road was very difficult in those days. We also took a side trip to visit the amazing and unusual lava tubes at Undara, some of the largest and most notable lava tubes in the world. On the way back to Cairns we visted many of the lookouts, waterfalls and interesting sights around the Atherton Tablelands.
