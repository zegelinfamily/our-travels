A quick school holiday trip coinciding with Chris's birthday. We stayed at a nice resort at Sanur and then visited Ubud for a few days. We also took a taxi over to Legian and Kuta where we had stayed on our honeymoon, but it had changed so much that it wasn't very nice anymore. After that we spent a week or so in Lombok, mainly staying at a resort, with a few taxi and bus trips to see some of the local sights.
