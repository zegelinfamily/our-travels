This was a wonderful trip with so much history to take in. We stuck to the mainland this time, first visiting Athens then staying for a week each at 2 different locations in the Peloponnese, taking day trips to the ancient sites in the area. This was followed by a road trip to the fantastic Vikos Gorge, Ioannina, Meteora and Royal Tombs of Philip II and family at Vergina. Then a relaxing week in a mountainous village near Volos. The village had the most dangerous 'road' to get to it youâ€™ll ever see, including driving 200 meters along a light rail track with cliff on one side, through a rail tunnel, with a bend in it, to the village! Fortunately the train only came a few times a day and went fairly slowly, but after doing it a few times we decided to park the car at the bottom of the mountain and walk up and down. After that, another road trip to Delphi and surrounds. Only downside was we had 900 photos to sort through when we got back.
