On this trip we decided to stick to Central Italy and thoroughly explore the area. After spending a wonderful week in Rome we headed out to the countryside staying in 3 airbnb's for over a week each. Highlights were visiting Hadrians Villa, Tarquinia and Ostia Antica and the beautiful hill town of Montone where we spent many day trips to other beautiful and interesting towns in the area. The towns around Lake Bolsena were also very interesting. We also managed to see a stage of the Giro d'Italia and even drove down a several kilometer section of the old Roman Appian Way, though we weren't sure if we were allowed to.
