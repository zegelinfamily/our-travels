Another epic trip, starting in Paris. Part of our airfare included a free side trip to almost anywhere in Europe so we visited friends in Switzerland. After returning to Paris we picked up my dads campervan and spent a leisurely 10 days or so following the Camino de Santiago - the Pilgrim’s Trail - along the north coast of Spain to Santiago de Compostela, then to Portugal. Portugal was incredibly interesting for such a small country, with the Duoro being a highlight. Lisbon wasn’t as interesting as we thought it would be, but all of Morocco was unforgettable. We then drove all the way back to Paris, which was a bit of an ordeal due to having bought some dirty diesel fuel as we left Morocco.
